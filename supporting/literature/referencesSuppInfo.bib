result characteristic of nonequilibrium theories of chromatography. An equation for the effective diffusion

expansion for flow velocity; a numerical result is acquired for a special limiting case.},

means to regulate the longitudinal flow veloclty. The trape-

ward the channel outlet, makes It possible to level out the
steep linear veloclty gradients that can appear In the rec-
tangular channels. Equations for the channel flow velocity
gradient and the void time are derived. I n addition, an
equatlon for the nonequillbrlum plate height Is derlved for
asymmetrical channels. The equation suggests that the same
efficiencies should be obtained In asymmetrical as In the
original symmetrical channels under similar flow conditions.
The relative peak dllutlon occurring In channels of different
designs Is evaluated. The results favor the trapezoidal versus
the rectangular channel and asymmetrical versus symmetrical
channels. The plate numbers calculated from the derived
equations were compared with those found experimentally.
The latter were found to deviate from the calculated numbers
at hlgh retention levels. Approximately 2600 plates have been

Three protein peaks, representing molecular weights from 12,000 to 136,000, wer completely resolved within 3 min. Flow programming speeds up the elution of the high-molecular-weight materials which occur late in a fractogram. This enabled separation of a small plasmid fragment (700 base pairs) from the large amounts of a big fragment (4600 base pairs) in 30 min and improved detection of a presumed trimer of albumin. Two viruses (1.8 10(6) and 50 10(6) daltons) were eluted as narrow peaks within 5 min.},

  Abstract                 = {Thermal field-flow fractionation (ThFFF) is an elution process that separates polymeric
materials by molecular weight. Elution profiles thus provide approximations to the molecular
weight distributions of polymers. The accuracy of such approximate distributions is expected to
be improved by accounting for the effect on the elution profile of band-broadening processes in
the FFF system. Fortunately this intrinsic band broadening, referred to as system dispersion, is
theoretically well-defined in ThFFF. In this article we present an algorithm that corrects ThFFF
elution profiles by removing system dispersion. The program is applied to ThFFF fractograms of
standard polymers having both narrow and broad molecular weight distributions. The increased
accuracy obtained by accounting for system dispersion is demonstrated. For the narrow standard,
deconvolution shows that the polydispersity (weight/number-average mol. wt.) is only 1.004. For
the broad standard, NBS 706, the molecular weight distribution and parameters obtained agree
well with previously published results. Application to a simulated fractogram resulting from
mixing five narrow standards helps define the conditions under which accurate molecular weight
information can be recovered},

Three different standard polystyrene particles (nominal radii of 30 and 40 and 50 nm) are fractionated with exponentially and linearly decaying cross-flows with different decay rates. Hydrodynamic radii are calculated according to retention theory including steric effects. Rapid decay is expected to give rise to systematic deviations in r(h) determination. The error in r(h) was found to be small when decay rates with half-lives longer than 6 min were used, whereas steeper decays could give rise to errors as high as 16\% of the particle size. The error is often explained in terms of secondary relaxation. However, comparisons show that experimental errors are significantly larger than what would be expected due to secondary relaxation, suggesting that other factors also have to be considered in order to fully understand deviations for rapidly decaying cross-flow.},

However, this is not always completely straight forward since non-idealities exist and assumptions have been made in deriving the retention equations. In this study we investigate the effect on accuracy from two factors: (1) level of sophistication of the equations used to determine channel height from a calibration experiment and (2) the influence of secondary relaxation on the accuracy of hydrodynamic radius determination. A new improved technique for estimating the channel height from calibration experiments is suggested. It is concluded that severe systematic error can arise if the most common channel height equations are used and an alternative more rigorous approach is described. For secondary relaxation it is concluded that this effect increases with the cross-flow decay rate. The secondary relaxation effect is quantified for different conditions. This is part one of two. In the second part the determination of hydrodynamic radius are evaluated experimentally under similar conditions.},

  abstract        = {This study suggests a novel method for determination of the channel height in asymmetrical flow field-flow fractionation (AF4), which can be used for calibration of the channel for hydrodynamic radius determinations. The novel method uses an oil-in-water nanoemulsion together with multi angle light scattering (MALS) and elution theory to determine channel height from an AF4 experiment. The method is validated using two orthogonal methods; first, by using standard particle elution experiments and, secondly, by imaging an assembled and carrier liquid filled channel by x-ray computed tomography (XCT). It is concluded that the channel height can be determined with approximately the same accuracy as with the traditional channel height determination technique. However, the nanoemulsion method can be used under more challenging conditions than standard particles, as the nanoemulsion remains stable in a wider pH range than the previously used standard particles. Moreover, the novel method is also more cost effective.},

Good method development practice (GMDP) and good fractogram practice (GFP) is suggested.},
